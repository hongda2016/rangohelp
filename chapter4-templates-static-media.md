# Templates and Static Media {#chapter-templates-static}
In this chapter, we'll be introducing the Django template engine, as well as showing how to serve *static media* files which can be integrated within your app's webpages.

## Using Templates
Up until this point, you have plugged a few things together to create a Django powered webpage. This is coupled to a view, which is in turn coupled with a series of URL mappings. Here we will delve into how to combine *templates* into the mix.

The layout from page to page within a website is often the same. Whether you see a common header or footer on a website's pages, the [repetition of page layouts](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/web-designer/effective-design-principles-for-web-designers-repetition/) aids users with navigation, promotes organisation of the website and reinforces a sense of continuity. [Django provides templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/) to make it easier for developers to achieve this design goal, as well as separating application logic (code within your views) from presentational concerns (look and feel of your app). In this chapter, you'll create a basic template which will be used to create a HTML page. This template will then be dispatched via a Django view. In the [chapter concerning databases and models](#chapter-models), we will take this a step further by using templates in conjunction with models to dispatch dynamically generated data.

Q> ### Summary: What is a Template?
Q> In the world of Django, think of a *template* as the scaffolding that is required to build a complete HTML webpage. A template contains the *static parts* of a webpage (that is, parts that never change), complete with special syntax (or *template tags*) which can be overridden and replaced with *dynamic content* that your Django app's views can replace to produce a final HTML response.

### Configuring the Templates Directory
To get templates up and running with your Django app, you'll need to create a directory in which template files are stored.

In your Django project's directory (e.g. `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/`), create a new directory called `templates`. Within the new templates directory, create another directory called `rango`. This means that the path `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/templates/rango/` will be the location in which we will store templates associated with our `rango` application.

T> ### Keep your Templates Organised
T> It's good practice to separate out your templates into subdirectories for each app you have. This is why we've created a `rango` directory within our `templates` directory. If you package your app up to distribute to other developers, it'll be much easier to know which templates belong to which app!

To tell the Django project where templates will be stored, open your project's `settings.py` file. Next, locate the `TEMPLATES` data structure. By default, when you create a new Django 1.9 project, it will look like the following.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	TEMPLATES = [
	    {
	        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
	        'DIRS': [],
	        'APP_DIRS': True,
	        'OPTIONS': {
	            'context_processors': [
	                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
	                'django.template.context_processors.request',
	                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
	                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
	            ],
	        },
	    },
	]

What we need to do to tell Django where our templates are stored is modify the `DIRS` list, and is set to an empty list by default. Change the dictionary key/value pair to look like the following.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	'DIRS': ['<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/templates']

Note that you are *required to use absolute paths* to locate the `templates` directory. If you are collaborating with team members or working on different computers, then this will become a problem. You'll have different usernames and different drive structures, meaning the paths to the `<workspace>` directory will be different. One solution would be to the path for each different configuration, for example:
	
{lang="python",linenos=off}

	'DIRS': [ '/Users/leifos/templates',
	          '/Users/maxwelld90/templates',
	          '/Users/clueless_noob/templates', ]

	
However, there are a number of problems with this. First you have to add in the path for each setting, each time. Second, if you are running the app on different operating systems the black slashes have to be constructed differently (see the warning below).

W> ### Don't hard code Paths!
W> The road to Hell is paved with hard coded paths. [Hard-coding paths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding) is a [software engineering anti-pattern](http://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns), and will make your project [less portable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_portability) - meaning that when you run it on another computer, it probably won't work!

### Dynamic Paths
A better solution is to make use of built-in Python functions to work out the path of your `templates` directory automatically. This way, an absolute path can be obtained regardless of where you place your Django project's code. This in turn means that your project becomes more *portable.* 

At the top of your `settings.py` file, there is a variable called `BASE_DIR`. This variable stores the path to the directory in which your project's `settings.py` module is contained. This is obtained by using the special Python `__file__` attribute, which is [set to the absolute path of your settings module](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9271479). The call to `os.path.dirname()` then provides the reference to the absolute path of the directory containing the `settings.py` module. Calling `os.path.dirname()` again removes another layer, so that `BASE_DIR` contains `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/`. You can see this process in action, if you are curious, by adding the following lines to your `settings.py` file.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	print(__file__)
	print(os.path.dirname(__file__))
	print(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))

Having access to the value of `BASE_DIR` makes it easy for you to reference other aspects of your Django project. As such, we can now create a new variable called `TEMPLATE_DIR` that will reference your new `templates` directory. We can make use of the `os.path.join()` function to join up multiple paths, leading to a variable definition like the example below.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	TEMPLATE_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

Here we make use of `os.path.join()` to mash together the `BASE_DIR` variable and `'templates'`, which would yield `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/templates/`. This means we can then use our new `TEMPLATE_DIR` variable to replace the hard coded path we defined earlier in `TEMPLATES`. Update the `DIRS` key/value pairing to look like the following.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	'DIRS': [TEMPLATE_DIR, ]

I> ### Why `TEMPLATE_DIR`?
I> You've created a new variable called `TEMPLATE_DIR` at the top of your `settings.py` file because it's easier to access should you ever need to change it. For more complex Django projects, the `DIRS` list allows you to specify more than one template directory - but for this book, one location is sufficient to get everything working.

W> ### Concatenating Paths
W> **When concatenating system paths together, always use `os.path.join()`.** Using this built-in function ensures that the correct path separators are used. On a UNIX operating system (or derivative of), forward slashes (`/`) would be used to separate directories, whereas a Windows operating system would use backward slashes (`\`). If you manually append slashes to paths, you may end up with path errors when attempting to run your code on a different operating system, thus reducing your project's portability.

### Adding a Template
With your template directory and path now set up, create a file called `index.html` and place it in the `templates/rango/` directory. Within this new file, add the following HTML code.

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	
	    <head>
	        <title>Rango</title>
	    </head>
	
	    <body>
	        <h1>Rango says...</h1>
	        <div>
	            hey there partner! <br /> 
	            <strong>{{ boldmessage }}</strong><br />
	        </div>
	        <div>
	            <a href="/rango/about/">About</a><br />
	        </div>
	    </body>
	
	</html>

From this HTML code, it should be clear that a simple HTML page is going to be generated that greets a user with a *hello world* message. You might also notice some non-HTML in the form of `{{ boldmessage }}`. This is a *Django template variable*. We can set values to these variables so they are replaced with whatever we want when the template is rendered. We'll get to that in a moment.

To use this template, we need to reconfigure the `index()` view that we created earlier. Instead of dispatching a simple response, we will change the view to dispatch our template.

In `rango/views.py`, check to see if the following `import` statement exists at the top of the file. If it is not present, add it.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	from django.shortcuts import render

You can then update the `index()` view function as follows. Check out the inline commentary to see what each line does.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	def index(request):
	    # Construct a dictionary to pass to the template engine as its context.
	    # Note the key boldmessage is the same as {{ boldmessage }} in the template!
	    context_dict = {'boldmessage': "Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake!"}
	    
	    # Return a rendered response to send to the client.
	    # We make use of the shortcut function to make our lives easier.
	    # Note that the first parameter is the template we wish to use.
	    return render(request, 'rango/index.html', context=context_dict)

First, we construct a dictionary of key/value pairs that we want to use within the template. Then, we call the `render()` helper function. This function takes as input the user's `request`, the template filename, and the context dictionary. The `render()` function will take this data and mash it together with the template to produce a complete HTML page. This is then returned and dispatched to the user's web browser.

I> ### What is the Template Context?
I> {#section-templates-static-context}
I> When a template file is loaded with the Django templating system, a *template context* is created. In simple terms, a template context is essentially a Python dictionary that maps template variable names with Python variables. In the template we created earlier, we included a template variable name called `boldmessage`. In our updated `index(request)` view example, the string `Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake!` is mapped to template variable `boldmessage`. The string `Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake!` therefore replaces *any* instance of `{{ boldmessage }}` within the template.

Now that you have updated the view to employ the use of your template, start the Django development server and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/rango/`. You should see your simple HTML template rendered, just like the [example screenshot shown below](#fig-ch4-first-template).

If you don't, read the error message presented to see what the problem is, and then double check all the changes that you have made. One of the most common issues people have with templates is that the path is set incorrectly in `settings.py`. Sometimes it's worth adding a `print` statement to `settings.py` to report the `BASE_DIR` and `TEMPLATE_DIR` to make sure everything is correct.

This example demonstrates how to use templates within your views. However, we have only touched upon a fraction of the functionality provided by the Django templating engine. We will use templates in more sophisticated ways as you progress through this book. In the meantime, you can find out more about [templates from the official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/).

{id="fig-ch4-first-template"}

## Serving Static Media {#section-templates-static-static}
While you've got templates working, your Rango app is admittedly looking a bit plain right now - there's no styling or imagery. We can add references to other files in our HTML template such as [*Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [*JavaScript*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and images to improve the show. These are called *static files*, because they are not generated dynamically by a Web server; they are simply sent as is to a client's Web browser. This section shows you how to set Django up to serve static files, and shows you how to include an image within your simple template.

### Configuring the Static Media Directory
To start, you will need to set up a directory in which static media files are stored. In your project directory (e.g. `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/`), create a new directory called `static` and a new directory called `images` inside `static`. Check that the new `static` directory is at the same level as the `templates` directory you created earlier in this chapter.

Next, place an image inside the `images` directory. As shown in below, we chose a picture of [the chameleon Rango](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1192628/) - a fitting mascot, if ever there was one.

{id="fig-ch4-rango"}
![Rango the chameleon within our `static/images` media directory.](images/ch4-rango-picture.png)

Just like the `templates` directory we created earlier, we need to tell Django about our new `static` directory. To do this, we once again need to edit our project's `settings.py` module. Within this file, we need to add a new variable pointing to our `static` directory, and a data structure that Django can parse to work out where our new directory is.

First of all, create a variable called `STATIC_DIR` at the top of `settings.py`, preferably underneath `BASE_DIR` and `TEMPLATES_DIR` to keep your paths all in the same place. `STATIC_DIR` should make use of the same `os.path.join` trick - but point to `static` this time around, just as shown below.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	STATIC_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')

This will provide an absolute path to the location `<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/static/`. Once this variable has been created, we then need to create a new data structure called `STATICFILES_DIRS`. This is essentially a list of paths with which Django can expect to find static files that can be served. By default, this list does not exist - **check** it doesn't before you create it. If you define it twice, you can start to confuse Django - and yourself.

For this book, we're only going to be using one location to store our project's static files - the path defined in `STATIC_DIR`. As such, we can simply set up `STATICFILES_DIRS` with the following.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	STATICFILES_DIRS = [STATIC_DIR, ]

T> ### Keep `settings.py` Tidy!
T> It's in your best interests to keep your `settings.py` module tidy and in good order. Don't just put things in random places; keep it organised. Keep your `DIRS` variables at the top of the module so they are easy to find, and place `STATICFILES_DIRS` in the portion of the module responsible for static media (close to the bottom). When you come back to edit the file later, it'll be easier for you or other collaborators to find the necessary variables.

Finally, check that the `STATIC_URL` variable is defined within your `settings.py` module. If it is not, then define it as shown below. Note that this variable by default in Django 1.9 appears close to the end of the module, so you may have to scroll down to find it.

{lang="python",linenos=off}

	STATIC_URL = '/static/'

With everything required now entered, what does it all mean? Put simply, the first two variables `STATIC_DIR` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` refers to the locations on your computer where static files are stored. The final variable `STATIC_URL` then allows us to specify the URL with which static files can be accessed when we run our Django development server. For example, with `STATIC_URL` set to `/static/`, we would be able to access static content at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/`. *Think of the first two variables as server-side locations, and the third variable as the location with which clients can access static content.*

X> ### Test your Configuration
X> As a small exercise, test to see if everything is working correctly. Try and view the `rango.jpg` image in your browser when the Django development server is running.
X> If your `STATIC_URL` is set to `/static/` and `rango.jpg` can be found at `images/rango.jpg`, what is the URL you enter into your Web browser's window?
X>
X> **Don't proceed until you are sure your configuration is working!**

W> ### Don't Forget the Slashes!
W> When setting `STATIC_URL`, check that you end the URL you specify with a forward slash (e.g. `/static/`, not `/static`). As per the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATIC_URL), not doing so can open you up to a world of pain. The extra slash at the end ensures that the root of the URL (e.g. `/static/`) is separated from the static content you want to serve (e.g. `images/rango.jpg`).

I> ### Serving Static Content
I> While using the Django development server to serve your static media files is fine for a development environment, it's highly unsuitable for a production environment. The [official Django documentation on deployment](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/static-files/deployment/) provides further information about deploying static files in a production environment. We'll look at this issue in more detail however when we deploy Rango.

### Static Media Files and Templates
Now that you have your Django project set up to handle static files, you can now make use of these files within your templates to improve their appearance and add additional functionality.

To demonstrate how to include static files, open up the `index.html` templates you created earlier, located in the `<workspace>/templates/rango/` directory. Modify the HTML source code as follows. The two lines that we add are shown with a HTML comment next to them for easy identification.

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<!DOCTYPE html>
	
	{% load staticfiles %} <!-- New line -->
	
	<html>
	    <head>
	        <title>Rango</title>
	    </head>
	    
	    <body>
	        <h1>Rango says...</h1>
	        
	        <div>
	            hey there partner! <br />
	            <strong>{{ boldmessage }}</strong><br />
	        </div>
	        
	        <div>
	            <a href="/rango/about/">About</a><br />
	            <img src="{% static "images/rango.jpg" %}"
	                 alt="Picture of Rango" /> <!-- New line -->
	        </div>
	    </body>
	    
	</html>

The first new line added ( i.e. `{% load staticfiles %}`) informs Django's template engine that we will be using static files with the template. This then enables us to access the media in the static directories via the use of the `static` [template tag](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/builtins/). This indicates to Django that we wish to show the image located in the static media directory called `images/rango.jpg`. Template tags are denoted by curly brackets (e.g. `{%  % }`), and calling `static` will combine the URL specified in `STATIC_URL` with `images/rango.jpg` to yield `/static/images/rango.jpg`. The HTML generated as a result would be:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<img src="{% static "/static/images/rango.jpg" %}" alt="Picture of Rango" /> 

If for some reason the image cannot be loaded, it is always a good idea to specify an alternative text tagline. This is what the ``alt`` attribute provides inside the `img` tag.

With these minor changes in place, start the Django development server once more and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/rango`. If everything has been done correctly, you will see a Webpage that looks similar to the [screenshot shown below](#fig-ch4-rango-site-with-pic).

{id="fig-ch4-rango-site-with-pic"}
![Our first Rango template, complete with a picture of Rango the chameleon.](images/ch4-rango-site-with-pic.png)

T> ### Templates and `<!DOCTYPE>`
T> When creating the HTML templates, always ensure that the [`DOCTYPE` declaration](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp) appears on the **fist line**. If you put the `{% load staticfiles %}` first then whitespace is added before the `DOCTYPE` declaration which can lead to your HTML code to [fail validation](https://validator.w3.org/).


T> ### Loading other Static Files
T> The ``{% static %}`` template tag call can be used whenever you wish to reference static files within a template. The code example below demonstrates how you could include JavaScript, CSS and images into your templates with correct HTML markup.
T>
T> {lang="html",linenos=off}



T> 	<!DOCTYPE html>
T> 	{% load staticfiles %}
T> 	
T> 	<html>
T> 	    
T> 	    <head>
T> 	        <title>Rango</title>
T> 	        <!-- CSS -->
T> 	        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "css/base.css" %}" />
T> 	        <!-- JavaScript -->
T> 	        <script src="{% static "js/jquery.js" %}"></script>
T> 	    </head>
T> 	
T> 	    <body>
T> 	        <!-- Image -->
T> 	        <img src="{% static "images/rango.jpg" %}" alt="Picture of Rango" />
T> 	    </body>
T> 	
T> 	</html>
T>
T> Static files you reference will obviously need to be present within your `static` directory. If a requested file is not present or you have referenced it incorrectly, the console output provided by Django's development server will show a [`HTTP 404` error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404). Try referencing a non-existent file and see what happens. Looking at the output snippet below, notice how the last entry's HTTP status code is `404`.
T>
T> {lang="text",linenos=off}

T> 	[10/Apr/2016 15:12:48] "GET /rango/ HTTP/1.1" 200 374
T> 	[10/Apr/2016 15:12:48] "GET /static/images/rango.jpg HTTP/1.1" 304 0
T> 	[10/Apr/2016 15:12:52] "GET /static/images/not-here.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 0
T>
T> For further information about including static media you can read through the official [Django documentation on working with static files in templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/static-files/#staticfiles-in-templates).

## Basic Workflow
With the chapter complete, you should now know how to setup and create templates, use templates within your views, setup and use the Django development server to serve static media files, *and* include images within your templates. We've covered quite a lot!

Creating a template and integrating it within a Django view is a key concept for you to understand. It takes several steps, but will become second nature to you after a few attempts.

1. First, create the template you wish to use and save it within the `templates` directory you specified in your project's `settings.py` module. You may wish to use Django template variables (e.g. `{{ variable_name }}`) or [template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/builtins/) within your template. You'll be able to replace these with whatever you like within the corresponding view.
2. Find or create a new view within an application's `views.py` file.
3. Add your view specific logic (if you have any) to the view. For example, this may involve extracting data from a database and storing it within a list.
4. Within the view, construct a dictionary object which you can pass to the template engine as part of the [template's *context*](#section-templates-static-context).
5. Make use of the  `render()` helper function to generate the rendered response. Ensure you reference the request, then the template file, followed by the context dictionary.
6. If you haven't already done so, map the view to a URL by modifying your project's `urls.py` file and the application specific `urls.py` file if you have one.

The steps involved for getting a static media file onto one of your pages is another important process you should be familiar with. Check out the steps below on how to do this.

1. Take the static media file you wish to use and place it within your project's `static` directory. This is the directory you specify in your project's `STATICFILES_DIRS` list within `settings.py`.
2. Add a reference to the static media file to a template. For example, an image would be inserted into an HTML page through the use of the `<img />` tag. 
3. Remember to use the `{% load staticfiles %}` and `{% static "<filename>" %}` commands within the template to access the static files. Replace `<filename>` with the path to the image or resource you wish to reference. **Whenever you wish to refer to a static file, use the `static` template tag!**

X> ### Exercises
X> Give the following exercises a go to reinforce what you've learnt from this chapter.
X> 
X> * Convert the about page to use a template as well, using a template called `about.html`.
X> * Within the new `about.html` template, add a picture stored within your project's static files.
X> * On the about page, include a line that says, `This tutorial has been put together by <your-name>`.

#TODO(leifos): Note that this not the best practice when you go to deployment, and that they should see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/howto/static-files/deployment/ and that the following solution works when ``DEBUG=True``

#TODO(leifos): the DEBUG variable in settings.py, lets you control the output when an error occurs, and is used for debugging. When the application is deployed it is not secure to leave DEBUG equal to True. When you set DEBUG to be False, then you will need to set the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py, when running on your local machine this would be ``127.0.0.1``. You will also need to update the project urls.py file:


.. code-block:: python


	from django.conf import settings # New Import
	from django.conf.urls.static import static # New Import


	if not settings.DEBUG:
		urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)


#TODO(leifos): Maybe we should describe all this in the deployment chapter... probably makes the most sense


The Static Media Server
-----------------------
Now that you can dispatch static files, let's look at uploading media. Many websites provide their users with the ability to do this - for example, to upload a profile image. This section shows you how to add a simple development media server to your Django project. The development media server can be used in conjunction with file uploading forms which we will touch upon in Chapter :ref:`login-label`.

So, how do we go about setting up a development media server? The first step is to create another new directory called ``media`` within our Django project's root (e.g. ``<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/``). The new ``media`` directory should now be sitting alongside your ``templates`` and ``static`` directories. After you create the directory, you must then modify your Django project's ``urls.py`` file, located in the project configuration directory (e.g. ``<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/tango_with_django_project/``). Add the following code to the ``urls.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python
	
	# At the top of your urls.py file, add the following line:
	from django.conf import settings
	
	# UNDERNEATH your urlpatterns definition, add the following two lines:
	if settings.DEBUG:
	    urlpatterns += patterns(
	        'django.views.static',
	        (r'^media/(?P<path>.*)',
	        'serve',
	        {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}), )

The ``settings`` module from ``django.conf`` allows us access to the variables defined within our project's ``settings.py`` file. The conditional statement then checks if the Django project is being run in `DEBUG <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/settings/#debug>`_ mode. If the project's ``DEBUG`` setting is set to ``True``, then an additional URL matching pattern is appended to the ``urlpatterns`` tuple. The pattern states that for any file requested with a URL starting with ``media/``, the request will be passed to the ``django.views.static`` view. This view handles the dispatching of uploaded media files for you.

With your ``urls.py`` file updated, we now need to modify our project's ``settings.py`` file. We now need to set the values of two variables. In your file, add ``MEDIA_URL`` and ``MEDIA_ROOT``, setting them to the values as shown below.




.. code-block:: python
	
	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
	MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') # Absolute path to the media directory

The first variable ``MEDIA_URL`` defines the base URL from which all media files will be accessible on your development server. Setting the ``MEDIA_URL`` for example to ``/media/`` will mean that user uploaded files will be available from the URL ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/``. ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is used to tell Django where uploaded files should be stored on your local disk. In the example above, we set this variable to the result of joining our ``PROJECT_PATH`` variable defined in Section :ref:`model-setup-templates-label` with ``/media/``. This gives an absolute path of ``<workspace>/tango_with_django_project/media/``.

.. caution:: As previously mentioned, the development media server supplied with Django is very useful for debugging purposes. However, it should **not** be used in a production environment. The official `Django documentation on static files <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#static-file-development-view>`_ warns that such an approach is *"grossly inefficient and insecure"*. If you do come to deploying your Django project, read the documentation to see an alternative solution for file uploading that can handle a high volume of requests in a much more secure manner.

You can test this setup works by placing an image file in your newly created ``media`` directory. Drop the file in, start the Django development server, and request the image in your browser. For example, if you added the file ``rango.jpg`` to ``media``, the URL you should enter would look like ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/rango.jpg``. The image should show in your browser. If it doesn't, you'll need to go back and check your setup.

#TODO(leifos): check that this still works (certainly you can access the images.. need to check the uploading)
