- In the Git chapter, we need to improve the cloning process so that we have a secure way for usernames and passwords to be stored without the need so people don't have to continually reenter them!
- In the Git chapter, we need to go over the rollback stuff again, there may be a better way of doing this.


- From Mike Gleen::: Another note: Sometimes I get confused with the various directories. In the case of creating the "templates" directory, maybe it would help to say something like: Create it in the directory containing manage.py.
