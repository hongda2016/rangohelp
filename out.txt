    $ python manage.py migrate

    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, sessions
    Running migrations:
      Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
      Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
      Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK


The migrate command looks at INSTALLED\_APPS in `settings.py` and for each app creates any necessary database tables. The database is configured according to the database settings
in `settings.py` file and the database migrations for each app. You’ll see a message for each
migration that is applied.

If you’re interested, run the command-line client (#TODO(leifos):which client?)
for your database and type dt (PostgreSQL), SHOW TABLES; (MySQL), or
.schema (SQLite) to display the tables Django created.







There are many Django
applications you can
[download](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources#Djangoapplicationcomponents)
and use in your projects. 


 For Django to pick your
mappings up, this tuple *must* be called `urlpatterns`. The
`urlpatterns` tuple contains a series of calls to the
`django.conf.urls.url()` function, with each call handling a unique
mapping.



**Footnotes**

[1]: There are many applications available out there that you can use in your project. Take a look at
    [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=django&submit=search)
    and [Django Packages](https://www.djangopackages.com/) to search for
    reusable apps which you can drop into your projects.
