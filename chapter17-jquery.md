#JQuery and Django

JQuery rocks! JQuery is a library written in Javascript that seriously
pimps its power and utility. A few lines of JQuery often encapsulates
hundreds of lines of javascript. JQuery provides a suite of
functionality that is mainly focused on manipulating HTML elements. In
this chapter, we will describe:

- how to incorporate JQuery within your Django Application
- explain how to interpret JQuery code
- and provide a number of small examples

##Including JQuery in Your Django Project/Application

In your *base* template include a reference to:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	{% load staticfiles %}
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js">
	<!-- OR if working from local -->
	<script src="{% static "js/jquery-2.1.4.js" %}"></script>
	<script src="{% static "js/rango-jquery.js" %}"></script>


Here we assume you have downloaded a version of the JQuery library, but
you can also just directly refer to it:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>


Make sure you have your static files set up (see Chapter setup-label)

In the static folder create a *js* folder and plonk the JQuery
javascript file (`jquery.js`) here along with an file called
`rango-jquery.js`, which will house our javascript code. In
`rango-jquery.js`, add the following javascript:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$(document).ready(function() {
		// JQuery code to be added in here.
	});


This piece of JQuery, first selects the document object (with
`$(document)`), and then makes a call to `ready()`. Once the document is
ready i.e. the complete page is loaded, then the anonymous function
denoted by `function(){ }` will be executed. It is pretty typical, if
not standard, to wait until the document has been finished loading
before running the JQuery functions. Otherwise, the code my try to run,
but the HTML elements may not have been downloaded (see
<http://api.jquery.com/ready/>).

I> ### Stylistic Note
I>
I> JQuery requires you to think in a more `functional` programming style, as opposed to the typical 
I> Javascript style which is often written in a more `procedural` programming style. For all the 
I> JQuery commands they follow a similar pattern: Select and Act. Select an element, and then act on I> the element. So it is good to keep this in mind. There are different selection operators, and 
I> various actions that can then be performed/applied. In the next, subsections we will take a few I> JQuery functions that you can use to manipulate the HTML elements.

###Example Popup Box on Click

In this example, we want to show you the difference between doing the
same functionality in standard Javascript versus JQuery.

In your `about.html` template, add the following piece of code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<button onClick="alert('You clicked the button using Javascript.');"> 
		Click Me - I run Javascript 
	</button>

As you can see, we are assigning the function `alert()` to the `onClick`
handler of the button. Load up the `about` page, and try it out.

Now lets do it using JQuery, by first adding another button:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<button id="about-btn"> Click Me - I'm Javascript on Speed</button>
		<p>This is a example</p>
		<p>This is another example</p>


Notice that there is not javascript code associated with the button
currently. We will be doing that with the following code added to
`rango-jquery.js`:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$(document).ready( function() {
		$("#about-btn").click( function(event) {
			alert("You clicked the button using JQuery!");
		});
	});

Reload the page, and try it out. Hopefully, you will see that both
buttons pop up an alert.

The JQuery/Javascript code here, first selects the document object, and
when it is ready, it executes the functions within its body, i.e.
`$("#about-btn").click()`, which selects the element in the page with id
equal to `about-btn`, and then it programatically assigns to the on
click event, the `alert()` function.

At first you might think that jQuery is rather cumbersome, as it
requires us to include a lot more code to do the same thing. This may be
true for a simple function like `alert()` but for more complex functions
it is much cleaner, as the JQuery/Javascript code is maintained in a
separate file (completely!!). This is because we assign the event
handler at run-time rather than statically within the code. We achieve
separation of concerns between the jquery/javascript code and the html
code.

T> ###Keep Them Separated
T>
T> Remember when it comes to CSS, JAVASCRIPT and HTML, you gotta keep
T> them separated!


###Selectors

There are different ways to select elements in JQuery. From the above
example, shows how the `#` can be used to find `id` elements in your
html document. To find classes, you can use `.`, so, for example, if we
added the following code:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$(".ouch").click( function(event) {
		alert("You clicked me! ouch!");
	});


Then all elements, that had a `class="ouch"` would be selected, and
assigned to its on click handler, the `alert()` function. Note that all
the elements would be assigned the same function.

Also, html tags can also be selected by referring to the tag in the
selector:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$("p").hover( function() {
		$(this).css('color', 'red');
	}, 
	function() {
		$(this).css('color', 'blue');
	});


Here, we are selecting all the `p` html elements, and on hover we are
associated two functions, one for on hover, and the other for hover off.
You can see that we are using another selector called, `this`, which
selects the element in question, and then sets it color to red or blue,
respectively. Note, the JQuery `hover()` function takes two functions
(see <http://api.jquery.com/hover/>), the JQuery `click()` requires the
event to passed through (see <http://api.jquery.com/click/>).

Try adding the above code your `rango-jquery.js` file, make sure it is
within the `$(document).ready()` function. What happens if you change
the `$(this)` to `$(p)`?

Hover, is an example of a mouse move event, for descriptions on other
such events, see: <http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/>

##DOM Manipulation Example

In the above example, we used the `hover` function to assign an event
handler to the on hover event, and then used the `css` function to
change the color of the element. The `css` is one example of DOM
manipulation, however, the stand JQuery library provides many other ways
to manipulate the DOM. For example, we can add classes to elements, with
the `addClass` function:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$("#about-btn").addClass('btn btn-primary')


This will select the element with id `#about-btn`, and assign the
classes `btn` and `btn-primary` to it. By adding these Bootstrap classes
will mean the button will now appear in the bootstrap style (assuming
you are using the Bootstrap toolkit).

It is also possible to access the html of a particular element. For
example, lets put a `div` in the `about.html`:

{lang="html",linenos=off}



	<div id="msg">Hello</div>


Then add the following JQuery to `rango-jquery.js`:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$("#about-btn").click( function(event) {
		msgstr = $("#msg").html()
		msgstr = msgstr + "o"
		$("#msg").html(msgstr)
	 });


On click of the element with id `#about-btn`, we first get the html
inside the element with id `msg` and append "o" to it. Then we change
the html inside the element by calling the `html` function again, but
this time passing through string `msgstr` to replace the html inside
that element.

In this chapter we have provided a very rudimentary guide to using JQuery
and incorporating it within your Django Application. From here you
should be able to understand how JQuery operates and experiment with the
different functions and libraries provided by JQuery and JQuery
developers (see <http://jquery.com>). In the next chapter we will be
using the JQuery to help provide AJAX functionality within Rango.
